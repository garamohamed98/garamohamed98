## Full Stack Developer | Java, Spring, React

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer who started coding back in high school, building small apps in Java just for fun — and maybe to sell one someday. After spending some time working as a seller and freelancing in design and video editing, I found my way back to what I enjoy most: solving real problems through code. I studied software engineering, dove into full-stack development with **Java** **Spring** and **React**, and now I’m looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and build meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out! 📩
